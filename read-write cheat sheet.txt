Read Modes:
'r': Opens the file in read-only mode. The file must exist. This is the default mode if no mode is specified.

Write Modes:
'w': Opens the file in write mode. If the file exists, it truncates the file (removes its contents). If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
'x': Opens the file for exclusive creation, meaning it fails if the file already exists.
'a': Opens the file in append mode. If the file exists, it appends the data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
'b': Binary mode. Used in conjunction with other modes, such as 'rb' or 'wb', to indicate binary file operations.

Read and Write Modes:
'r+': Opens the file in read and write mode. The file must exist.
'w+': Opens the file in read and write mode. If the file exists, it truncates the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
'a+': Opens the file in append and read mode. If the file exists, it appends the data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
